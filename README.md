# 🏡🐈 Cat House

This layout was provided by my instructor, and I used it to practice CSS Grid.
The markup and main styles were pre-made, so my focus was on working with grid
structures.

## To make the page more engaging:

- Added links to relevant articles in the headings — you can click on any title
  to read more.
- Included all available UA Animals social media links since they fit well with
  the theme.
- Finally, I added a video, which was not in the original layout.

Enjoy exploring! 😊
